Summary:
--------
OpenTREP aims at providing a clean API, and the corresponding C++
implementation, for parsing travel-focused requests (e.g.,
"washington dc beijing monday a/r +aa -ua 1 week 2 adults 1 dog").

OpenTREP uses Xapian (http://www.xapian.org) for the Information Retrieval part,
on freely available travel-related data (e.g., country names and codes,
city names and codes, airline names and codes, etc.).

OpenTREP exposes a simple, clean and object-oriented, API. For instance,
the static Parse() method takes, as input, a string containing the travel
request, and yields, as output, the list of the recognised terms as well as
their corresponding types. As an example, the travel request
"washington dc beijing monday a/r +aa -ua 1 week 2 adults 1 dog" would give
the following list:
  * Origin airport: Washington, DC, USA
  * Destination airport: Beijing, China
  * Date of travel: next Monday
  * Date of return: 1 week after next Monday
  * Preferred airline: American Airlines; non-preferred airline: United Airlines
  * Number of travellers: 2 adults and a dog

The output can then be used by other systems, for instance to book the
corresponding travel or to visualise it on a map and calendar and to
share it with others.

OpenTREP makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.


Getting and installing from the Fedora/CentOS/RedHat distribution:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Just use Yum:
yum -y install opentrep-devel opentrep-doc

You can also get the RPM packages (which may work on Linux
distributions like Novel Suse and Mandriva) from the Fedora repository
(e.g., for Fedora 17, 
http://fr2.rpmfind.net/linux/fedora/releases/17/Everything/)


Building the library and test binary from Git repository:
---------------------------------------------------------
The Sourceforge Git repository may be cloned as following:
git clone https://github.com/trep/opentrep.git opentrepgit
cd opentrepgit
git checkout trunk

Then, you need the following packages (Fedora/RedHat/CentOS names here, 
but names may vary according to distributions):
  * cmake
  * gcc-c++
  * boost-devel / libboost-dev
  * python-devel / python-dev
  * gettext-devel / gettext-dev
  * doxygen
  * tetex-latex (optional)
  * rpm-build (optional)

Building the library and test binary from the tarball:
------------------------------------------------------
The latest stable source tarball (opentrep*.tar.gz or .bz2) can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=252803

To customise the following to your environment, you can alter the path
to the installation directory:
export INSTALL_BASEDIR=/home/user/dev/deliveries
export LIBSUFFIX_4_CMAKE="-DLIB_SUFFIX=64"

Then, as usual:
* To configure the project, type something like:
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/opentrep-0.5.3 \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DINSTALL_DOC:BOOL=ON \
   -DRUN_GCOV:BOOL=OFF ${LIBSUFFIX_4_CMAKE} ..
* To build the project, type:
  make
* To test the project, type:
  make check
* To install the library (libopentrep*.so*) and the binary (opentrep), just type:
  make install
  cd ${INSTALL_BASEDIR}
  rm -f opentrep-stable && ln -s opentrep-0.5.3 opentrep-stable
  cd -
* To package the source files, type:
  make dist
* To package the binary and the documentation:
  make package
* To run the local binary version:
  ./opentrep/opentrep -b
* To run the installed version (the first following line must be done once
  per session; replace lib by lib64 if on a 64-bit platform):
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/opentrep-stable/lib
  ${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/opentrep-stable/bin/opentrep -b

Running the Django-based application server:
--------------------------------------------
# Replace lib by lib64 if on a 64-bit platform:
export TREP_LIB=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/opentrep-stable/lib
# Optional:
export TREP_TRAVELDB=/tmp/opentrep/traveldb
export TREP_LOG=django_trep.log
cd appserver/django/trep
# The first time, the database must be initialised:
#./manage.py syncdb localhost:8000
./manage.py runserver localhost:8000
# Check that everything went fine with, for instance:
midori http://localhost:8000/trep/api/"rio de janero reykyavik sna francicso"
