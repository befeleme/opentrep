	- The search and indexation pieces of algorithm have been completely
	revamped. Every multi-word string now gives birth to a new C++ structure,
	namely StringPartition, made of all its partitions in an exhaustive
	manner. All those string partitions are indexed by Xapian. And an
	independant search is performed on every one of those string partitions;
	a global match, made of the combination from several match-based
	pieces of algorithm, is then assigned to every string partition;
	the best matching string partition is then selected.
	That new search algorithm allows, among other things, to combine several
	independant matching methods, including heuristic ones.
	- The MySQL database is no longer needed. The ORI-maintained list of POR
	(points of reference) is now parsed, thanks to Boost.Spirit v2.
	A copy of that file is kept under the data/por/ sub-directory.
