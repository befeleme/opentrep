0.3.0, 2009.03.29 (r48)

    o The new SOCI RPM (temporarily on 
	http://downloads.sourceforge.net/opentrep/soci-3.0.0.tar.gz)
	can now be used.

0.2.0, 2009.03.02 (r23)

    o Airports and cities can now be searched by names, even though
	that search is still limited. Hence, it may be easier to use the
	Xapian simplesearch utility (e.g., ¨simplesearch test/traveldb
	cdg¨). Spelling suggestions are even made for mispelled
	airport/city names.
	

0.1.0, 2009.02.23 (r20)

    o Two binaries are delivered (./configure && make): 
	- Indexer, which can be launched (only once is needed) from the 
	test directory, with the './testIndexer.sh' command.
	- Searcher, which can be launched (each time a query needs to be 
	matched/searched) from the test directory, with the 
	'./testSearcher.sh' command. The retrieval of data from the MySQL, 
	thanks to SOCI, is very slow (over a minute on a AMD64 3GHz).
	It has to be fixed, either by changing the way it is done within 
	SOCI, or by parsing a file (e.g., with Boost Spirit) instead of
	retrieving data from a MySQL database.
