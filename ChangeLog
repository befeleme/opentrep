	* Sun Feb 02 2014 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.6.0
	- Issue #1 (http://github.com/trep/opentrep/issues/1):
	The search algorithm is now modular.
	- Issues #3 (https://github.com/trep/opentrep/issues/3)
	and #5 (https://github.com/trep/opentrep/issues/5):
	POR are now indexed with their associated PageRank value
	(equal to 0.1% when there is no PageRank vallue).
	- Latest ORI POR data:

	* Sun Feb 24 2013 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.5.3
	- Fixed a bug hindering the new slice and dice algorithm to fully work.
	  That latter now seems to fully work.

	* Sat Feb 16 2013 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.5.2
	- The new slice and dice algorithm seems to work now. More thorough tests
	are needed.

	* Sat Feb 16 2013 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.5.1
	- Updated the source code to the newest format of the ORI-maintained list
	  of POR.
	- Added the Geonames-derived feature names (e.g., "nce city" now returns
	  the POR for the city of Nice, France).

	* Sun Oct 14 2012 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.5.0
	- The search and indexation pieces of algorithm have been completely
	revamped. Every multi-word string now gives birth to a new C++ structure,
	namely StringPartition, made of all its partitions in an exhaustive
	manner. All those string partitions are indexed by Xapian. And an
	independant search is performed on every one of those string partitions;
	a global match, made of the combination from several match-based
	pieces of algorithm, is then assigned to every string partition;
	the best matching string partition is then selected.
	That new search algorithm allows, among other things, to combine several
	independant matching methods, including heuristic ones.
	- The MySQL database is no longer needed. The ORI-maintained list of POR
	(points of reference) is now parsed, thanks to Boost.Spirit v2.
	A copy of that file is kept under the data/por/ sub-directory.

	* Sat Nov 12 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.4.1
	- Added pragmas to have the code compatible with the new
	Soci-3.1.0 version.
	- Removed any reference to ExtraCC

	* Tue Nov 01 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.4.0
	- The build system is now based on CMake (instead of the GNU
	Autotools).

	* Sun Mar 29 2009 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.3.0
	- Now relies on the new SOCI RPM.

	* Sun Mar 22 2009 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora at m4x.org> 0.2.0
	- RPM release for Fedora 10
