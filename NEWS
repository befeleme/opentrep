* 2013-04-28:
- Version 0.5.4
- Something

* 2013-03-10:
- Version 0.5.3
- Fixed a bug hindering the new slice and dice algorithm to fully work.
  That latter now seems to fully work.

* 2013-02-16:
- Version 0.5.2
- The new slice and dice algorithm seems to work now. More thorough tests
  are needed.

* 2013-02-16:
- Version 0.5.1
- Updated the source code to the newest format of the ORI-maintained list
  of POR.
- Added the Geonames-derived feature names (e.g., "nce city" now returns
  the POR for the city of Nice, France).

* 2012-10-14:
- Version 0.5.0
- The search and indexation pieces of algorithm have been completely revamped.
  Every multi-word string now gives birth to a new C++ structure, namely
  StringPartition, made of all its partitions in an exhaustive manner.
  All those string partitions are indexed by Xapian. And an independant search
  is performed on every one of those string partitions; a global match, made of
  the combination from several match-based pieces of algorithm, is then
  assigned to every string partition; the best matching string partition is
  then selected.  That new search algorithm allows, among other things,
  to combine several independant matching methods, including heuristic ones.
- The MySQL database is no longer needed. The ORI-maintained list of POR
  (points of reference) is now parsed, thanks to Boost.Spirit v2.
  A copy of that file is kept under the data/por/ sub-directory.

* 2011-11-12:
- Version 0.4.1
- Added pragmas to have the code compatible with the new Soci-3.1.0 version
- Removed any reference to ExtraCC

* 2011-11-01:
- Version 0.4.0
- The build system is now based on CMake (instead of the GNU Autotools)

* 2009-03-29:
- Version 0.3.0
- Now relies on the new SOCI RPM

* 2009-03-22:
